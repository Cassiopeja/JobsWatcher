# Project

JobsWatcher is a simple project that I have implemented while studying ASP.NET Core and Vue.js.
The  main purpose of the project is to watch for new jobs from [HeadHunters web site](https://headhunter.ru).

The application allows the user to filter and rate job descriptions.
This is the repository for the backend of the application. The frontend repository maybe found here: [jobs-watcher-web](https://github.com/Cassiopeja/jobs-watcher-web).

# Implementation uses
- REST API: ASP.NET Core
